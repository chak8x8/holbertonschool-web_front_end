Description

### Quiz
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

- **HTML - elements of a web page**

### Welcome!
In this project, you will learn how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. **No CSS, no styling** – so your final page may look “plain”, and that’s perfectly fine for now! The main focus is on learning the semantics and correct usage of HTML.

**Important:** details matter! Lowercase vs uppercase, correct letter usage… be careful with your syntax to avoid errors.
